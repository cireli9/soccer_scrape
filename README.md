# soccer_scrape

Utilized to scrape data from the Premier League website. A very rough program that currently does not include red cards and will swap Yellow Cards/Fouls if there are 0 Yellow Cards during a match. Can be easily edited to scrape data from years besides 2017-2018. Depending on speed of internet connection, SCROLL_PAUSE_TIME may need to be changed and the program may need to be run multiple times before it successfully executes.
